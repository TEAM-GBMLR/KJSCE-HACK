> ### Need for the project (Why?)

* Currently, people from different fields such as ideators, developers, testers & marketing people are hard to find under one roof.
* Our primary objective is to bring the above mentioned type of people together under one common environment and hence reduce the hassle of finding them.
* Currently, no such platform exists and hence      it is our endeavour to create a         multi-functionality collaborative environment.
