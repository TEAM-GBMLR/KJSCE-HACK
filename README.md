## Need for the project (Why?)

* Currently, people from different fields such as ideators, developers, testers & marketing people are hard to find under one roof.
* Our primary objective is to bring the above mentioned type of people together under one common environment and hence reduce the hassle of finding them.
* Currently, no such platform exists and hence      it is our endeavour to create a         multi-functionality collaborative environment.

## About the idea (How?)

1. Ideator posts a idea
2. Developer is interested in the proposed idea
3. Ideator approves developer
4. Developer applies for the project idea
5. Ideator-Developer Collaboration starts
6. Invite other developers & testers
7. Tester gives clearance  
8. Project proceeds to deployment
9. Marketing/ Investors
10. Deployed in the market              


## Scope of project

* This project would help the ideators to turn their dream ideas into reality faster.

* A well formed network of ideators, developers, testers and marketers would be established and would hence help bridge the gap that currently exists.

* Would provide a very good opportunity for freelancers to take up short term projects and would also help students to test their practical concepts by working on a real-life project.
